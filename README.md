# College Search

Simple application developed as part of a technical assessment.

## Setup

- Ruby version: 3.3.4
- Ruby on Rails version: 7.1.3.4
- No databases

The API keys required need to be added to the environment variables:

export GOOGLEMAPSAPIKEY="Some-Key-here"
export SCORECARDAPIKEY="Some-Key-here"

Why environmental variables? 
This may not be the most safe option, but is easy to setup and I didn't wanted to waste time with something more complex.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
